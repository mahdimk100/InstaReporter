This code uses a virtual platform to send duplicate reports to an Instagram account.

The first part of the code calls the requests library, which is used to send HTTP requests to websites.

The login and report_user functions are defined to log into the Instagram account and send the report to the desired user, respectively. These functions need to implement Instagram website details for logging in and reporting, here these parts are shown as #Same as before... for simplicity.

In the __main__ section:

your_username and your_password should be replaced with your username and password.
user_id_to_report should be replaced with the user ID of the user you want to report.
num_reports is the number of reports you want to send.
Then, this code has a for loop that calls the report_user function num_reports times to report the desired user. On each run, a message is printed to indicate that the current report has completed. Finally, the message "All reports completed." is printed to indicate that all reports have been completed.
